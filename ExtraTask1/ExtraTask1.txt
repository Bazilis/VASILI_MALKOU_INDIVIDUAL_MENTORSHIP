There is a dictionary (case insensitive) containing letters of the English alphabet as keys.
Each element of the dictionary has a value in the form of a linked list (LinkedList).
Every linked list contains last names beginning with key characters.
Users have a queue with last names as an input. The last name starts with any case.
You need to take each last name from the input queue and add it to the corresponding linked list based on the first character of the last name.

Example:

Input:
"Johnson", "Williams", "Brown", "Janes"

Output:
a:
b: "Brown"
c:
d:
e:
f:
g:
h:
